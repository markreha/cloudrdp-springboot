# GCU Cloud Platform - Research Project 2020-2020

Research Question: Can we design and build a fully functioning Private Cloud Platform using a cluster of Raspberry PIâ€™s using current Cloud Technologies?

This repository contains the code to support the Cloud Java Docker API that is based on the Fabric8io Java Kubernetes API Cient library.

This project should be build with standard Java Eclipse using Java 8 and exported as a JAR file.

GCU Custom Java Docker API
--------
The Cloud Portal Application communicates to the Cloud via using a GCU custom Java Docker API that leverages the Fabric8io Java Kubernetes API Cient library internally within its implementation.
